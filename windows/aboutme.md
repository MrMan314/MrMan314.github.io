## About Me

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a young age, I have been interested in coding and anything computer related.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have mostly been a self-taught learner in many areas, such as programming, software applications, hardware and networking knowledge.  When I first told my parents  how interested I was in programming, they found a website called [Sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/).  This was the beginning of my self-taught programming journey.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have developed several websites and programs on my own by researching on sites such as Google, Reddit, and StackOverflow.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of my recent projects include setting up a Postfix Mail server and linking it with RoundCube Webmail, setting up a multi-site Apache httpd server, and modifying the Linux kernel to allow for PCIe Passthrough on "unsupported" devices.  I have also since gotten interested in Cybersecurity and began doing some challenges on PicoCTF.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also comfortable working with hardware.  I have built and assembled many different types of electronics, set up enterprise-grade servers, and disassembled and reassembled laptops and phones.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can work with Single Board Computers and microcontrollers, which are more challenging, but at the same time, interesting to me, as I had to make many low-level modifications to the bootloader and kernel.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have advanced soldering skills, which enable me to modify electronics, attach different devices, make devices work, and test new configurations.
